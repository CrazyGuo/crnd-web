Widget allows you to popup images from the binary fields. It is available on the tree view.

How it works:

1. Announce widget on the form view:

    .. code:: xml

        <field name="image_test" widget="image_popup" class="oe_avatar"/>

2. You can also announce widget on the tree view:

    .. code:: xml

        <field name="image_test" widget="image_popup" class="ot_image"/>

  The `ot_image` CSS class resizes the image for the tree view (you can use your own class).

In the edit mode it works as a standard image widget.
